# VideoStreaming

Developed a cross-platform video streaming platform where users can gift movies to Friends/Family with Next.js and React to ensure a consistent user experience on web and mobile interfaces. To efficiently manage user data, video content, and streaming metadata, I implemented Prisma as the database 
ORM and utilized MongoDB for data storage. Additionally, a scalable backend with Node.js will enable the platform to handle increased user activity and content growth while maintaining optimal performance and reliability.'
